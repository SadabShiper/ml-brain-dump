# ML Brain Dump

Learning ML/DL one concept at a time and writing it down so I don't forget.
If it helps you too, that's a bonus.

**i read, i learn, i write, you learn, we learn**

## What's Inside

This repository contains my personal notes on machine learning and deep learning topics. 
These are written as I learn them - mistakes, confusions, and all. 
No pretending to be an expert here.

## Current Topics

- Seq2Seq Models (Basic and Attention-based)
- More coming as I learn...

## Why This Exists

I forget things easily. Writing helps me remember. 
Sharing helps others. Simple as that.
